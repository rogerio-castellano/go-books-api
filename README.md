# Books API in Go

This is a straightforward example of a REST API developed in Go. 
As I continue to enhance my proficiency in the language, I acknowledge the potential for numerous improvements. 
These include implementing a request router, refactoring to separate concerns across various files, validating input, among others. 
I will be making these upgrades progressively as my expertise in Go develops.
